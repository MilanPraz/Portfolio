## Overview

The Real-Time Chat Application is a web-based communication platform designed to enable instant messaging and audio calling with low latency. The application focuses on delivering a smooth, responsive user experience across devices while maintaining reliable real-time performance.

It combines socket-based messaging with WebRTC-powered audio calls, providing a unified interface for seamless communication.

## Key Challenges

- Implementing low-latency real-time messaging using socket-based communication.
- Integrating WebRTC for audio calling while maintaining stable connections.
- Designing a responsive UI that works seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices.
- Optimizing performance to ensure smooth message delivery and UI updates under frequent state changes.

## Key Learnings

- Working with real-time systems improved understanding of event-driven architectures.
- WebRTC integration required careful handling of signaling, peer connections, and media streams.
- Managing application state efficiently was essential for preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- Performance optimization played a key role in delivering a smooth communication experience.

## Uniqueness

- Real-time messaging combined with audio calling in a single application.
- Clean and intuitive UI designed for seamless communication.
- Responsive layout optimized for different screen sizes.
- Focus on low-latency interactions and user experience.

## Impact
