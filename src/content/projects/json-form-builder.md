## Overview

The JSON Form Builder is a dynamic web-based tool designed to simplify the creation and configuration of forms. It allows users to customize input components in real time and instantly generate JSON output representing the form structure and properties.

The tool is built to support flexible form configuration while maintaining clarity, usability, and reliability throughout the form-building process.

## Key Challenges

- Designing a flexible system to dynamically render different input components based on configuration.
- Managing real-time updates while editing component properties without causing unnecessary re-renders.
- Ensuring generated JSON accurately reflects the form structure and user-defined settings.
- Implementing robust validation logic to prevent invalid or incomplete form submissions.

## Key Learnings

- Building dynamic UI systems improved understanding of component abstraction and reusability.
- Managing complex form state required careful handling to keep updates predictable and performant.
- Real-time preview significantly improved usability by providing immediate visual feedback.
- Validation logic played a critical role in ensuring reliable and user-friendly form creation.

## Uniqueness

- Real-time customization of form inputs and their properties.
- Instant preview alongside JSON output for seamless configuration and integration.
- Clean and intuitive UI focused on usability rather than complexity.
- Designed to support a wide range of form use cases through flexible configuration.

## Impact

- Simplified form creation for developers and non-technical users alike.
- Reduced manual effort by generating structured JSON configurations automatically.
- Improved reliability of form submissions through built-in validation.
- Provided a reusable foundation for form-driven applications and integrations.
